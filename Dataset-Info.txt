This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.
Tumor genomic clusters and patient data is provided in data.csv file.

In digital image processing and computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects).

Tasks a CNN can accomplish:
Classification – categorizing the entire image into a class such as “people”, “animals”, “outdoors”
Object detection – detecting objects within an image and drawing a rectangle around them, for example, a person or a sheep.
Segmentation – identifying parts of the image and understanding what object they belong to. Segmentation lays the basis for performing object detection and classification.
